# Inter_Banking_payments_Hyperledger_Fabric
WHY(Need)?
  The current financial network is centralized over the central bank and it plays the main role in
carrying out the inter banking payments. This bring a tremendous load on a the central bank also making it a single point of failure system. This very situation can be tackled by implementing the Real-time Gross Settlement on blockchain platform. 
  The project is build using the hyperledger fabric and demostrates a simple transaction of 10 units from A to B in a de-centralized manner on a private channel. 
  
HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT-
step1: Generate the crypto-materials
  ./byfn.sh generate
step 2: Start the network
  ./byfn.sh up
step 3: Bring Down the network
  ./byfn.sh down
